// for making UI of the dev tinder, we use react+vite
// React + Vite simply means using React (a frontend library) together with Vite 
// (a build tool / bundler) to create fast, modern web applications.

// Here’s the breakdown:

// 🔹 React

// A JavaScript library for building UI components.

// Lets you create single-page applications (SPAs).

// Uses concepts like components, props, state, hooks, and virtual DOM.

// 🔹 Vite

// A next-generation frontend build tool made by the creator of Vue.js.

// Works as a faster alternative to Webpack, CRA (Create React App), and Parcel.

// Provides:

// ⚡ Super fast development server (starts instantly, no long waits).

// 📦 Optimized production build (uses Rollup under the hood).

// 🛠️ Hot Module Replacement (HMR) (changes show instantly in the browser without reloading).

// 🚀 Lightweight and easy configuration.

// 🔹 React + Vite Together

// When you combine them:

// React provides the UI framework.

// Vite provides the development and build tooling.

// 👉 Developers often use Vite instead of Create React App (CRA) because it’s much faster and more modern.

// A bundler is a tool that takes all the different files in your project (JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.)
//  and combines them into optimized files that browsers can understand and load efficiently.
