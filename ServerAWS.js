// "localhost" means your own computer.

// It is a hostname (like a website address) that points back to the same device you are working on.

// Technical meaning: localhost resolves to the IP address 127.0.0.1 (IPv4) or ::1 (IPv6).

// Usage:

// When you type http://localhost in your browser, it tells your browser to connect to a web server running on your own computer.

// Developers use it for testing apps, websites, or databases on their own system before deploying them to a real server.

// ðŸ‘‰ Example:
// If you run a server on your computer at port 3000, you can open it in the browser by visiting:

// http://localhost:3000

// so to make our application or website visible to everyone we need to host our website onto some other 
// machine so that everyone can accress that and that machine is given by AWS
// that machine is the central place  from where we can access the website from accross the all over world
